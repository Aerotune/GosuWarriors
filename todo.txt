* Move the landing code to the land state
* Jumping movement fix for air attacks
* Refactor the motion system with ids and cleanups

* Add effects overlay in sprite sheet editor (eg. glow)

* Add spawn points in sprite sheet editor
** Spawn entities
** Spawn vfx/dust/particles

* Level editor, I'm thinking about making it similar to the sprite sheet editor
